# Objections & Crisp Answers

## “Why not use a CMMS?”
Asora is inventory-only by design.  
CMMS systems conflate work execution with inventory truth, reducing audit fidelity.

## “Why not spreadsheets?”
Spreadsheets lack:
- Append-only history
- Enforcement
- Tenant isolation
- Audit defensibility

## “Why not ERP inventory modules?”
ERP inventory is often secondary to financial workflows.  
Asora treats inventory as the primary system of record.

## “What about automation?”
Asora prioritizes correctness over automation.  
All automation must be additive and enforcement-safe.

## “Can this scale?”
Yes. All core mechanisms are deterministic, tenant-scoped, and limit-enforced.

No answer here relies on future roadmap claims.
